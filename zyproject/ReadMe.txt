    1   Please see the path tree. 
        when you have a new support file, please create a new folder by date and put this support file into this folder.
        
        for example 
            "customers/cosco_bj/2018_1_2/support_file.zip" 

        only chacractor in [a-z0-9_] is allowed for support_file name. 
        when you get a support file with wrong name format like "zyWAF_support_(2).zip" please rename it. 

        this is example:
                customers/  zy_sh.sh   ReadMe.txt  zytmp  zytools
                ├── cosco_bj/2018_1_2/support_file.zip
                └── guangxi_university_for_nationalities

    2   when you finished put it in right place , you can run ./zy_fp.sh by manuel 

    3   this script will try to find out false positive automatically.
